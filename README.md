## 👋 Hi, I'm Matías Quero :D

I'm a student at **Hive Helsinki**, where we've been building low-level projects in C and C++, including our own libraries, graphics renderers, and network servers.  
Outside of school, I’ve also explored JavaScript and Python through small web apps and tools.  
Before tech, I was a **professional musician** — and I still see rhythm, structure, and creativity as essential in writing clean, thoughtful code.
