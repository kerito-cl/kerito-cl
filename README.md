## 👋 Hi, I'm Matías Quero :D

I'm a student at **Hive Helsinki**, where we've been tackling a range of hands-on projects — from building our own C libraries to working on graphics, system-level programming, and server development.  
Along the way, I’ve also explored JavaScript and Python in personal side projects, experimenting with web apps and tools outside the curriculum.

---

### 🚧 What I'm Learning
- Building reliable and efficient programs in **C/C++**
- Understanding how web apps work through **React**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**
- Exploring concepts like multithreading, sockets, and rendering

### 🌱 Projects I've worked on

🛎️ [**Hotel Booking**](https://github.com/kerito-cl/hotel-booking)  
A learning project where I built a basic hotel booking platform using the MERN stack.  
Includes login/signup, hotel search, and a simple dashboard.  
This was my first full-stack project with a decent grasp of how frontend and backend connect.

🧪 [**Mini RayTracing**](https://github.com/kerito-cl/Ray_Tracing)  
A small ray tracer written in C with multithreading support.  
Simulates light, reflection, and materials to render basic 3D scenes.
👥 Built in collaboration with [Daniel Xifeng](https://github.com/danielxfeng)


📡 [**IRC Server**](https://github.com/juusokasperi/ft_irc)  
A simplified IRC server written in C++98.  
It handles multiple clients using non-blocking sockets and supports core IRC commands.
👥 Created together with [Juuso Rinta](https://github.com/juusokasperi) and [Heidi Enbuska](https://github.com/mochoteimoso)


🌀 [**Minishell**](https://github.com/your-username/minishell)  
A basic shell clone in C.  
Handles redirections, pipes, environment variables, and built-in commands.
👥 Developed with [Ipersids](https://github.com/ipersids)

### 🎶 Fun fact

Before all this, I worked as a **professional musician** — and now I enjoy translating creative thinking into code.  
I still believe rhythm, structure, and harmony apply to good software too.

Thanks for stopping by!
